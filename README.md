Forked from https://github.com/closedcontour/very-smart-select

A much smarter, drop-in replacement to the default Expand/Shrink Selection commands.

Currently supported languages:
* Typescript (.ts, .tsx)
* JavaScript (.js, .jsx)
* JSON

For these languages, the TypeScript compiler is used to find smart selection expansions.

For unsupported languages, defaults to the original Expand/Shrink Selection.
